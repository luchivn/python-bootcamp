# Coffee Machine Project

This project simulates a coffee machine that serves drinks based on available ingredients and money input. It tracks resources, processes user input, and handles transactions.

I created two versions of the project:

- **coffee-machine.py**: written using procedural programming
- **coffee-machine-oop**: rewritten using Object-Oriented Programming principles
